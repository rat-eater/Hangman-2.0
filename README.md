This is my "improved" version of the Hangman Assignment for MM-201-G 24H Programming.
The code may still have a couple of bugs I was not able to fix, due to my limited knowledge. 
I tried improving the code all by myself with the help of a few YouTube videos ( for example this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upDLs1sn7g4&list=PLTjRvDozrdlxEIuOBZkMAK5uiqp8rHUax )
I haven't reached out to the teachers for help due to poor time management and I take full responsibility for my grade!
